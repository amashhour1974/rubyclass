Training Delivery {.unnumbered}
-------------------------------

  * Ruby Basics

    The first day is spent coming up to speed on Ruby, its syntax, and
    how to write object-oriented applications with it.  By the end of
    the day students will have spent the majority of their time
    writing and experimenting with Ruby.  Students will be comfortable
    and confident when using the interactive Ruby environment (IRB)
    and the MiniTest testing framework.

    Students will be exposed to the following concepts during the
    first day:

    - Ruby Background, Design Goals, and Implementations
    - Basic Introduction to Ruby's Syntax
    - Object-oriented programming in Ruby
    - Basic Control Flow and Conditional Expressions
    - Core Ruby Collection Classes (Array and Hash)
    - Syntax Literals for Core Ruby Classes
    - Blocks and the Iteration Pattern
    - Converting Variables Between Core Types
    - How to Read and Understand Ruby Documentation
    - Unit Testing with [MiniTest][]

  * Practical Ruby

    During their second day, students will experiment with the more
    practical side of Ruby by creating a RubyGem and performing tasks
    such as reading data from files.  Topics from the first day will
    be reinforced while knowledge of Ruby's syntax and core classes
    will be deepened.

    In order to achieve these goals, the following topics will be
    taught during the second day:

    - Functional Programming Concepts in Ruby
    - I/O and File Handling
    - Instance Method Visibility and Keywords
    - Class Methods vs. Instance Methods
    - Working With Regular Expressions in Ruby
    - Using Modules to Create Namespaces
    - RubyGems and Dependency Management
    - Specification Testing with [RSpec][]

  * Intermediate Ruby

    For the final day, students will be exposed to intermediate Ruby
    concepts while continuing to practice the skills learned during
    the first two days.  By digging into topics such as exceptions,
    debugging, and optimization, students will leave with real world
    Ruby skills.

    Students will become familiar with and practice the following
    intermediate and (slightly) advanced features of Ruby:

    - Writing an Interactive Script
    - More Advanced Control Flow Expressions
    - Using Modules for Code Sharing
    - Method Dispatching and the Inheritance Hierarchy
    - Exception Handling and Error Recovery
    - Interactive Debugging of Ruby Code
    - Common Optimization Techniques
